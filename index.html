                <p>I'm a freshman at BYU Idaho, this is my first semester, and I'm majoring in web development and design. I'm from Phoenix, Arizona. I served my mission in the Montana Billings Mission.</p>
                <p>I love to go fishing and spend time outdoors. I also love working with computers which is why I decided to major in web development and design. My favorite sports are football and baseball, and I'm a fan of all of the Arizona sports teams.</p>
                <p>I have been a member of the church for about 8 years now. I'm a convert in the church, I was baptized when I was 14 years old. I'm the only member of the church in my family.</p>
